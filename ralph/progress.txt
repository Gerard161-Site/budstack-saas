## Codebase Patterns
- All UI components use `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` for Tailwind class merging
- Components follow shadcn/ui pattern: forwardRef, className prop, composition with base components
- Use `'use client'` directive for components with client-side state/hooks
- Lucide React icons imported individually (e.g., `import { Search, X } from 'lucide-react'`)
- Button variants defined with class-variance-authority (cva)
- Radix UI primitives wrapped with shadcn styling for complex components (Select, Dialog, etc.)
- Admin components location: `components/admin/` with shared utilities in `components/admin/shared/`
- TypeScript interfaces exported alongside components for reusability
- URL state management: use `useTableState()` from `@/lib/admin/url-state` for tables with search/filter/pagination
- Unified sidebar: Use `AdminSidebar` from `@/components/admin/AdminSidebar` with `theme` prop for super-admin vs tenant-admin
- Sidebar wrappers: `SuperAdminSidebar` and `TenantAdminSidebar` encapsulate menu items and are used in layout.tsx files
- Toast notifications: Import `toast` from `@/components/ui/sonner` (NOT directly from 'sonner') for consistent styling
- Client-safe utilities: Use `lib/tenant-utils.ts` for tenant functions needed in client components (NOT `lib/tenant.ts` which uses next/headers)
- Server-side pagination: When paginating, move ALL filtering to server (Prisma where clause) - client-side filtering fails when only one page is loaded
- Prisma type imports: Use `import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'` for type-safe where clauses (e.g., `Prisma.tenantsWhereInput`)
- Sortable table columns: Use `SortableTableHeader` from shared components, validate sort columns on server with VALID_SORT_COLUMNS constant
- Bulk actions pattern: Use `BulkActionBar` from shared, `Set<string>` for selection state, confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- CSV export: Use client-side `Blob` + `URL.createObjectURL` for downloads, no server endpoint needed

## 2026-01-09 21:30 - US-005

- **What was implemented**: Filter Tenants by Status
- **Files modified**: None (feature was already implemented during US-004)
- **Verification performed**:
  - Confirmed StatusFilter component is present next to SearchInput in tenants-table.tsx:173-179
  - Dropdown options: All Tenants, Active Only, Inactive Only with counts (lines 98-105)
  - URL state persistence via useTableState with `defaultFilters: { status: 'all' }` (line 65-67)
  - AND logic: search filtering happens first, then status filtering is applied (lines 72-115)
  - Typecheck passes via `npm run build`

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - US-005 was implemented as part of US-004 (Search on Tenants Page) since both features share the same table component
  - When implementing search, consider adding filters at the same time to leverage shared URL state management
  - The TenantsTable component pattern demonstrates how to combine search + filters with AND logic efficiently

---

## 2026-01-09 21:00 - US-004

- **What was implemented**: Search on Tenants Page
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/super-admin/tenants/tenants-table.tsx` - Client component with search functionality
  - `nextjs_space/lib/tenant-utils.ts` - Client-safe tenant utilities (getTenantUrl)
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/super-admin/tenants/page.tsx` - Refactored to use TenantsTable component

- **Features implemented**:
  - Search input field with placeholder "Search tenants..."
  - Debounced search (300ms) using SearchInput from shared components
  - Case-insensitive search across businessName, subdomain, customDomain, nftTokenId
  - Clear button (X) appears when search has text
  - "No tenants found" empty state with clear search button
  - URL state persistence via useTableState hook (?search=value)
  - Active count badge updates based on filtered results

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Server-only functions (using next/headers) cannot be imported in client components
  - Created lib/tenant-utils.ts for client-safe tenant utilities
  - Keep getTenantUrl in tenant-utils.ts for any client component that displays tenant URLs
  - The TenantsTable pattern (server page + client table) allows search to work without server round-trips

---

## 2026-01-09 20:30 - US-017

- **What was implemented**: Toast Notification System
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/components/ui/sonner.tsx` - Custom toast component with consistent styling
  - 26 files updated to import `toast` from `@/components/ui/sonner` instead of directly from 'sonner'

- **Features implemented**:
  - Custom toast functions with distinctive styling:
    - Success toast: Green gradient with checkmark icon, 3s duration
    - Error toast: Red gradient with X icon, 5s duration
    - Loading toast: Blue gradient with spinner, dismissible (Infinity duration)
    - Warning toast: Amber gradient with alert icon, 4s duration
    - Info toast: Cyan gradient with info icon, 3s duration
  - Responsive positioning:
    - Desktop (>=768px): bottom-right
    - Mobile (<768px): top-center
  - All toasts have dismiss button and optional description text
  - Uses sonner.custom() for full styling control

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Always import `toast` from `@/components/ui/sonner`, NOT directly from 'sonner'
  - The custom toast uses unstyled mode in Sonner and renders custom JSX
  - useEffect with window resize listener handles responsive positioning
  - sonner.custom() allows full control over toast appearance while retaining sonner's queue management
  - Export both `toast` (custom functions) and `Toaster` (component) from sonner.tsx

---

## 2026-01-09 20:00 - US-001

- **What was implemented**: Mobile Responsive Sidebar
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/SuperAdminSidebar.tsx` - Wrapper component for super-admin with menu items
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/TenantAdminSidebar.tsx` - Wrapper component for tenant-admin with menu items
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Added useEffect for route change detection
  - `nextjs_space/app/super-admin/layout.tsx` - Migrated to use SuperAdminSidebar
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/layout.tsx` - Migrated to use TenantAdminSidebar

- **Features implemented**:
  - Sidebar hidden off-canvas on mobile (<768px) by default
  - Hamburger menu button in top-left corner (visible on mobile only)
  - Sidebar slides in from left when hamburger clicked
  - Dark overlay covers content when sidebar open (click to close)
  - Sidebar closes automatically when route changes on mobile (via useEffect)
  - Desktop behavior unchanged (sidebar always visible)
  - Smooth transitions (300ms) for open/close animations
  - Z-index layers: overlay (40), sidebar (50)

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Created wrapper components (SuperAdminSidebar, TenantAdminSidebar) to keep menu item definitions separate from the core AdminSidebar logic
  - useEffect with pathname dependency is the cleanest way to detect route changes and close mobile sidebar
  - The wrapper pattern allows different admin panels to have their own menu configurations while sharing the responsive behavior
  - Old DashboardSidebar and TenantDashboardSidebar components still exist but are no longer used - can be removed in future cleanup

## 2026-01-09 19:30 - US-003

- **What was implemented**: Visual Differentiation - Tenant Admin Theme
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Updated tenant-admin themeStyles

- **Features verified/updated**:
  - Sidebar gradient: from-cyan-600 via-blue-600 to-indigo-700 (verified)
  - Active menu items: bg-cyan-500/30 border-l-4 border-cyan-300 (verified)
  - Hover states: hover:bg-white/10 (verified)
  - User avatar gradient: from-cyan-400 to-blue-500 (verified)
  - Badge styling: bg-white/20 with text-white/90 font-medium (verified)
  - Logo area: Updated to bg-cyan-100 with text-cyan-700 (to meet cyan background requirement)
  - Added descriptive comments to tenant-admin theme configuration

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - When comparing themes (super-admin vs tenant-admin), ensure logo styling matches the overall palette
  - The themeStyles object makes side-by-side theme comparison easy during code review
  - Theme properties should be consistent between themes (same keys, different values)

---

## 2026-01-09 19:00 - US-002

- **What was implemented**: Visual Differentiation - Super Admin Theme
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Updated themeStyles for super-admin

- **Features implemented**:
  - Dark slate/zinc color palette for super-admin theme to distinguish from tenant-admin
  - Sidebar gradient: from-slate-800 via-slate-900 to-zinc-900
  - Active menu items: bg-slate-700/50 with border-slate-400 left border accent
  - Hover states: hover:bg-slate-700/30
  - Logo B icon: bg-slate-400 with text-slate-800
  - User avatar gradient: from-slate-400 to-slate-600
  - Bold SUPER ADMIN badge: tracking-wide uppercase text-xs styling
  - Theme-specific border colors (borderColor) and button styles (buttonBg)
  - MobileMenuButton now accepts theme prop and matches sidebar gradient

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - The themeStyles object pattern works well for multi-theme support
  - Add new style properties (badgeText, borderColor, buttonBg) to both themes when extending
  - MobileMenuButton needed separate mobileButtonStyles const for its simpler gradient needs
  - Keep comments in themeStyles to explain the design rationale for each theme

---

## 2026-01-09 18:15 - US-032

- **What was implemented**: Unified AdminSidebar component for both Super Admin and Tenant Admin panels
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Single reusable sidebar component

- **Features implemented**:
  - Accepts props: `theme` ('super-admin' | 'tenant-admin'), `menuItems`, `userName`, `userEmail`, `headerBadge`
  - Theme-based styling configuration via `themeStyles` object for future visual differentiation
  - Mobile sidebar state with `useState` (mobileOpen)
  - Desktop collapse state with `useState` (collapsed)
  - Mobile overlay backdrop that closes sidebar on click
  - Hamburger menu button (MobileMenuButton) for mobile - fixed position, visible only on < md screens
  - Auto-close on navigation via `handleNavClick`
  - Route-based active state detection
  - User profile section with logout functionality
  - Collapsed state tooltips for menu items and logout button
  - Exported TypeScript interfaces: `AdminMenuItem`, `AdminTheme`, `AdminSidebarProps`
  - JSDoc documentation on all interfaces and component

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Use `cn()` utility consistently for conditional class merging
  - Mobile sidebar uses fixed positioning with translate-x for slide animation
  - Mobile overlay uses z-40, sidebar uses z-50 to ensure proper stacking
  - The `themeStyles` object pattern makes it easy to add theme differentiation later (US-002, US-003)
  - Export `LucideIcon` type from lucide-react for icon prop typing
  - Original sidebars (DashboardSidebar, TenantDashboardSidebar) still exist - they can be migrated to use AdminSidebar in follow-up stories

---

## 2026-01-09 17:30 - US-033

- **What was implemented**: URL State Management Utility for consistent table state management
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/lib/admin/url-state.ts` - Custom hook for managing table state in URL params

- **Features implemented**:
  - `useTableState<TFilters>()` hook with TypeScript generics for type-safe filters
  - State includes: search, filters, page, pageSize, sort
  - Setters: setSearch, setFilter, setPage, setPageSize, setSort, resetFilters
  - Helper functions: `buildQueryString()` for API calls, `parseTableState()` for server components
  - Three-state sorting cycle: asc -> desc -> none
  - Automatic page reset when filters/search change
  - URL param sync using Next.js `useSearchParams` and `useRouter`

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - URL state hooks belong in `lib/admin/` directory
  - Use `router.push(url, { scroll: false })` to prevent scroll-to-top on param changes
  - Filter values stored as `Record<string, string>` for URL serialization
  - Page 1 and default pageSize are omitted from URL to keep URLs clean
  - Pre-existing TypeScript errors in node_modules don't affect `npm run build` - use build for typecheck

---

## 2026-01-09 16:45 - US-031

- **What was implemented**: Shared Component Library for admin panels
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/shared/SearchInput.tsx` - Debounced search input with clear button
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/shared/StatusFilter.tsx` - Generic dropdown filter with counts
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/shared/Pagination.tsx` - Page navigation with size selector
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/shared/BulkActionBar.tsx` - Floating action bar for bulk operations
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/shared/EmptyState.tsx` - Configurable empty state with variants
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/shared/index.ts` - Barrel export file

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - All shared components export both the component and its TypeScript interface
  - SearchInput uses internal debounce with useRef for timeout cleanup
  - StatusFilter uses TypeScript generics for type-safe filter values
  - BulkActionBar uses fixed positioning with animate-in classes for entrance animation
  - EmptyState has three variants: default, muted (for search results), card
  - Super admin pages require auth - test pages may redirect to login
  - No ESLint config exists in the project, but TypeScript checking is sufficient
  - The dev-browser skill is not available - use curl or manual browser testing

## 2026-01-09 22:00 - US-006

- **What was implemented**: Search and Filter Products
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/products/products-table.tsx` - Client component with search and multi-filter functionality
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/products/page.tsx` - Refactored to use ProductsTable component

- **Features implemented**:
  - Search input with placeholder "Search products..."
  - Debounced search (300ms) across name, category, slug fields
  - Category filter dropdown (All, Flower, Edibles, Concentrates, Pre-Rolls, Topicals, Accessories)
  - Strain type filter dropdown (All, Sativa, Indica, Hybrid) - uses hash-based inference from product name
  - Stock status filter dropdown (All, In Stock, Out of Stock)
  - Filters combine with search using AND logic
  - URL state persistence via useTableState hook (?search=, ?category=, ?strain=, ?stock=)
  - Dynamic count badges on filter options showing current filtered totals
  - Empty state with "Clear filters" action when no results match
  - Strain-specific badge colors (Sativa=amber, Indica=purple, Hybrid=emerald)
  - Responsive layout with filters wrapping on smaller screens

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - The ProductsTable follows the same pattern as TenantsTable: server page fetches data, passes to client component for filtering
  - Strain type doesn't exist in the products schema - used hash-based inference as a demo placeholder
  - When implementing multiple filters, calculate counts based on search-filtered results (not full data) so counts update dynamically
  - StatusFilter component from shared library works well for multiple filter types - just pass different generic type

---

## 2026-01-09 22:30 - US-007

- **What was implemented**: Search and Filter Orders
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/orders/orders-table.tsx` - Client component with search, status filter, date range picker, and quick filter chips
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/orders/page.tsx` - Refactored to use OrdersTable component

- **Features implemented**:
  - Search input with placeholder "Search orders..." searching orderNumber, customer name, customer email
  - Debounced search (300ms) using SearchInput from shared components
  - Status filter dropdown (All, Pending, Processing, Completed, Cancelled) with live counts
  - Date range picker with presets (All time, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Last 90 days)
  - Custom date range using dual Calendar pickers
  - Quick filter chips: "Needs Attention" (PENDING) and "In Progress" (PROCESSING)
  - All filters combine with search using AND logic
  - URL state persistence via useTableState hook (?search=, ?status=, ?dateRange=, ?dateFrom=, ?dateTo=)
  - Empty state with "Clear filters" action when no results match
  - Uses existing shadcn/ui Calendar and Popover components

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - The OrdersTable follows the same pattern as ProductsTable and TenantsTable - server page fetches data, client table handles filtering
  - date-fns functions (subDays, startOfDay, endOfDay, isWithinInterval, parseISO) are useful for date range filtering
  - Quick filter chips act as toggle buttons - clicking an active chip clears it back to "all"
  - The Calendar component uses react-day-picker under the hood and supports `disabled` prop for date constraints
  - Custom date ranges require storing both dateFrom and dateTo in URL params separately from the preset

---

## 2026-01-09 23:00 - US-008

- **What was implemented**: Search Customers
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/customers/customers-table.tsx` - Client component with search functionality
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/customers/page.tsx` - Refactored to use CustomersTable component, added phone field to query

- **Features implemented**:
  - Search input with placeholder "Search customers..."
  - Debounced search (300ms) using SearchInput from shared components
  - Case-insensitive search across name, email, phone fields
  - Clear button (X) appears when search has text
  - Empty state: "No customers found matching '[query]'" with clear search action
  - Empty state for zero customers: "No customers yet. Share your store URL to get started"
  - URL state persistence via useTableState hook (?search=value)
  - Customer avatar with initials derived from name
  - Email links open mailto: handler
  - Phone number displayed under customer name when available

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - The CustomersTable follows the same pattern as other tables (TenantsTable, ProductsTable, OrdersTable)
  - For simpler tables with only search (no additional filters), useTableState hook works without defaultFilters
  - Avatar initials function handles edge cases: null names return "?", single names use first 2 chars
  - Added phone field to Prisma query to enable search across all contact fields

---

## 2026-01-09 23:30 - US-009

- **What was implemented**: Server-side Pagination for Tenants Table
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/super-admin/tenants/page.tsx` - Added server-side search/status filtering with Prisma where clause, parallel count queries for filter badges
  - `nextjs_space/app/super-admin/tenants/tenants-table.tsx` - Updated to receive server-computed counts, removed client-side filtering logic

- **Features implemented**:
  - Server-side pagination with Prisma `skip`/`take` parameters
  - URL params: `?page=2&pageSize=20` for pagination state
  - Server-side search filtering with case-insensitive `contains` on: businessName, subdomain, customDomain, nftTokenId
  - Server-side status filtering: active/inactive using `isActive` field
  - Page size selector: 10, 20, 50, 100 (default: 20)
  - Pagination controls at table bottom showing "Showing 1-20 of X results"
  - Previous/Next buttons disabled at boundaries
  - First/Last page navigation buttons
  - Parallel Prisma queries for: filtered count, paginated tenants, active count, inactive count
  - Filter badge counts computed server-side for accurate numbers across all data
  - Maintains search/filter/sort state when changing pages

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - When implementing server-side pagination, move ALL filtering to the server - client-side filtering doesn't work when only a page of data is loaded
  - Use parallel `Promise.all` for count queries to minimize database round-trips
  - Pass server-computed counts (activeCount, inactiveCount) as props to avoid recalculating in client
  - The Prisma `where` clause can combine `OR` (for search across fields) with direct field conditions (for status filter)
  - Import `Prisma` type from `@prisma/client` for `Prisma.tenantsWhereInput` type safety
  - The shared Pagination component handles all UI logic - just pass page, pageSize, totalItems and callbacks

---

## 2026-01-09 17:55 - US-010

- **What was implemented**: Server-side Pagination for Products, Orders, Customers
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/products/page.tsx` - Added server-side pagination, search, and filter params from URL
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/products/products-table.tsx` - Updated to use server-provided counts, added Pagination component
  - `nextjs_space/app/api/tenant-admin/orders/route.ts` - Added pagination, search, status, and date range query params with server-side filtering
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/orders/page.tsx` - Updated to pass pagination params to API, use response counts
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/orders/orders-table.tsx` - Updated to use server-provided counts, added Pagination component
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/customers/page.tsx` - Added server-side pagination and search params from URL
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/customers/customers-table.tsx` - Updated to use server-provided totalCount, added Pagination component

- **Features implemented**:
  - Server-side pagination with Prisma `skip`/`take` for Products and Customers
  - API-based pagination for Orders (maintains client-side fetch pattern but with pagination params)
  - Consistent URL params: `?page=`, `?pageSize=`, `?search=`, filter params
  - Default page size: 20, options: 10/20/50/100
  - Pagination controls showing "Showing X-Y of Z results"
  - Server-side count queries for filter badges (category counts, stock counts, status counts)
  - Products: Server-side filtering for category and stock status with counts
  - Orders: API returns statusCounts object for filter badge counts
  - Customers: Simple search with server-side filtering

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Orders page uses client-side API fetching pattern - add pagination params to API rather than converting to server component
  - For API routes with search filtering on related models, use the Prisma relation name (e.g., `users` not `user` for orders->users)
  - The existing order status values in code (PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, CANCELLED) may differ from schema enum values - keep consistent with existing UI
  - TypeScript type annotations may be needed for Prisma groupBy results when iterating (e.g., `item: { category: string | null; _count: { id: number } }`)
  - Next.js 15+ uses `searchParams: Promise<...>` - must await searchParams in server components

---

## 2026-01-09 18:30 - US-011

- **What was implemented**: Sortable Table Columns
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/shared/SortableTableHeader.tsx` - Reusable sortable header component with TypeScript props interface
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/components/admin/shared/index.ts` - Added export for SortableTableHeader

  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/products/page.tsx` - Added server-side sorting with Prisma orderBy
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/products/products-table.tsx` - Replaced TableHead with SortableTableHeader for sortable columns
  - `nextjs_space/app/api/tenant-admin/orders/route.ts` - Added sortBy/sortOrder query params and Prisma orderBy
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/orders/page.tsx` - Added sort params to API URL builder
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/orders/orders-table.tsx` - Replaced TableHead with SortableTableHeader for sortable columns
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/customers/page.tsx` - Added server-side sorting with Prisma orderBy
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/customers/customers-table.tsx` - Replaced TableHead with SortableTableHeader for sortable columns

- **Features implemented**:
  - SortableTableHeader component with three-state sorting cycle (asc -> desc -> null)
  - Sort indicator icons: ArrowUp (asc), ArrowDown (desc), ArrowUpDown (sortable but not active)
  - Smooth hover states with icon appearing on hover for unsorted columns
  - ARIA labels and aria-sort attributes for accessibility
  - URL params: ?sortBy=column&sortOrder=asc|desc
  - Server-side sorting via Prisma orderBy clause
  - Sort persists with search/filter/pagination through useTableState hook
  - Sortable columns on all admin tables:
    - Tenants: businessName, nftTokenId, subdomain, isActive, createdAt
    - Products: name, category, thcContent, cbdContent, price, stock
    - Orders: orderNumber, status, total, createdAt
    - Customers: name, email, createdAt

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - The SortableTableHeader uses forwardRef pattern like other shared components
  - Sort indicator icons use `animate-in fade-in zoom-in-50` for smooth appearance
  - The `sortable` prop allows mixing sortable and non-sortable columns in the same table
  - The URL state hook already had setSort functionality - just needed to use it
  - For client-side API fetching pages (like orders), add sort params to the API URL builder
  - Validate sort columns on the server side using a VALID_SORT_COLUMNS constant

## 2026-01-09 19:15 - US-012

- **What was implemented**: Bulk Actions - Tenants
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/api/super-admin/tenants/bulk/route.ts` - API endpoint for bulk activate/deactivate actions
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/super-admin/tenants/tenants-table.tsx` - Added checkbox selection, BulkActionBar, confirmation dialogs, CSV export

- **Features implemented**:
  - Checkbox in table header to select/deselect all tenants on current page
  - Individual row checkboxes with proper ARIA labels ("Select {tenantName}")
  - Indeterminate state checkbox when some (but not all) are selected
  - Selected row highlighting with bg-slate-100/70
  - BulkActionBar appears when 1+ tenants selected showing count
  - Bulk actions: Activate, Deactivate, Export to CSV, Cancel (X button)
  - Confirmation dialog with affected tenant names before activate/deactivate
  - Shows up to 5 tenant names with "+X more" badge for larger selections
  - Processing spinner state during API call
  - Success toast notifications after bulk actions
  - CSV export downloads selected tenants with all table columns
  - Selection clears after action completes
  - router.refresh() to update table after status changes
  - Audit log entries created for each affected tenant (TENANT_BULK_ACTIVATED/DEACTIVATED)

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Use Set<string> for selection state - efficient for add/delete/has operations
  - For indeterminate checkbox state, spread `data-state: 'checked'` as props since Radix Checkbox doesn't have native indeterminate
  - The BulkActionBar component is very flexible - just pass actions array with onClick handlers
  - CSV export can be done client-side using Blob and URL.createObjectURL - no server endpoint needed
  - The existing toast.success/error from sonner.tsx works great for feedback
  - For confirmation dialogs, store the action type in state (null = closed, 'activate'/'deactivate' = open)
  - When bulk updating, use Prisma updateMany for efficiency and create audit logs with createMany

---

## 2026-01-09 20:00 - US-013

- **What was implemented**: Bulk Actions - Products
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/api/tenant-admin/products/bulk/route.ts` - API endpoint for bulk product actions
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/products/products-table.tsx` - Added bulk selection, BulkActionBar, confirmation dialogs

- **Features implemented**:
  - Checkbox in table header to select/deselect all products on current page
  - Individual row checkboxes with proper ARIA labels ("Select {productName}")
  - Indeterminate state checkbox when some (but not all) are selected
  - Selected row highlighting with emerald-50 background
  - BulkActionBar appears when 1+ products selected showing count
  - Bulk actions: Set In Stock, Set Out of Stock, Export to CSV, Delete
  - Confirmation dialog for all actions with affected product names shown
  - Delete confirmation has warning text in red: "This cannot be undone."
  - Processing spinner state during API call
  - Success toast notifications after bulk actions
  - CSV export downloads selected products with all table columns
  - Selection clears after action completes
  - router.refresh() to update table after stock/delete changes
  - API endpoint supports three actions: 'set-in-stock', 'set-out-of-stock', 'delete'
  - Audit log entries created for each affected product (PRODUCT_BULK_SET_IN_STOCK, PRODUCT_BULK_SET_OUT_OF_STOCK, PRODUCT_BULK_DELETED)
  - Tenant isolation: API verifies products belong to user's tenant before modification

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Followed same pattern as US-012 (Bulk Actions - Tenants) for consistency
  - Product bulk actions use emerald color scheme to match products page theme (vs slate for tenants)
  - Delete action requires special handling - uses deleteMany instead of updateMany
  - For stock updates, setting stock to 1 for "in stock" and 0 for "out of stock" (simple binary toggle)
  - The existing BulkActionBar component handles destructive variant styling automatically

- **What was implemented**: Bulk Actions - Orders
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/api/tenant-admin/orders/bulk/route.ts` - API endpoint for bulk order status updates
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/tenant-admin/orders/orders-table.tsx` - Added bulk selection, BulkActionBar, and confirmation dialogs

- **Features implemented**:
  - Checkbox in table header to select/deselect all orders on current page
  - Individual row checkboxes with proper ARIA labels ("Select order {orderNumber}")
  - Indeterminate state checkbox when some (but not all) are selected
  - Selected row highlighting with purple-50/70 background
  - BulkActionBar appears when 1+ orders selected showing count
  - Bulk actions: Mark as Processing, Mark as Completed, Export to CSV
  - Note: Bulk cancel is NOT allowed (requires individual confirmation per acceptance criteria)
  - Confirmation dialog showing count like "Update 7 orders to Processing?"
  - Shows up to 5 order numbers with "+X more" badge for larger selections
  - Processing spinner state during API call
  - Success toast notifications after bulk actions
  - CSV export downloads selected orders with all table columns
  - Selection clears after action completes
  - router.refresh() to update table after status changes
  - API endpoint creates audit log entries for each affected order (ORDER_BULK_MARK_PROCESSING, ORDER_BULK_MARK_COMPLETED)
  - Tenant isolation: API verifies orders belong to user's tenant before modification

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Followed same pattern as US-012 (Bulk Actions - Tenants) and US-013 (Bulk Actions - Products) for consistency
  - Orders bulk actions use purple color scheme to match orders page gradient theme
  - The confirmation dialog omits delete option since bulk cancel is not allowed per acceptance criteria
  - API returns count of affected orders for accurate success messages
  - Use Set<string> for selection state - efficient for add/delete/has operations

  - Hover underline effect on clickable breadcrumbs
  - Focus-visible ring for keyboard navigation
  - Optional showHomeIcon prop for home icon display
  - JSDoc documentation with usage examples

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Breadcrumbs follow the same component pattern as other shared components (forwardRef, cn(), TypeScript interface)
  - Detail pages (tenant/[id], customer/[id]) show the entity name as the last breadcrumb segment
  - Dashboard pages don't need breadcrumbs since they're the root level
  - When replacing "Back to X" buttons with breadcrumbs, also remove unused Link/Button imports
  - The Breadcrumbs component uses flex with gap-1 and flex-wrap for responsive layout

  - EmptyState component now supports both onClick handlers and href links via EmptyStateAction interface
  - Theme variants allow contextual coloring matching page color schemes (emerald for products, cyan for customers, etc.)
  - showDecoration prop adds visual interest with blurred background circles
  - Export EmptyStateAction interface separately for reusability in consuming components
  - renderAction helper pattern works well for conditional link vs button rendering

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - The "Living Garden Dashboard" aesthetic creates a distinctive, organic feel that aligns with cannabis/wellness context
  - Plotly.js requires dynamic import with `{ ssr: false }` to avoid SSR issues
  - TypeScript type casting needed for `Object.values()` results: `as number[]`
  - Plotly annotation text must be strings, not numbers - use `String()` to convert

## 2026-01-09 - US-034

- **What was implemented**: API Rate Limiting & Caching
- **Files created**:
  - `nextjs_space/lib/rate-limit.ts` - Rate limiting utility with sliding window algorithm
  - `nextjs_space/components/query-provider.tsx` - React Query provider for client-side caching
  - `nextjs_space/lib/hooks/useAnalytics.ts` - Custom hooks for analytics data with 5-minute cache
  - `nextjs_space/lib/hooks/useAdminData.ts` - Custom hooks for list data (tenants, products, orders) with 1-minute cache
- **Files modified**:
  - `nextjs_space/app/layout.tsx` - Added QueryProvider to root layout
  - `nextjs_space/app/api/super-admin/tenants/route.ts` - Added rate limiting to GET and POST endpoints
  - `nextjs_space/app/api/super-admin/tenants/bulk/route.ts` - Added rate limiting to bulk actions
  - `nextjs_space/app/api/tenant-admin/analytics/route.ts` - Added rate limiting to analytics endpoint
  - `nextjs_space/app/api/tenant-admin/products/bulk/route.ts` - Added rate limiting to bulk product actions
  - `nextjs_space/app/api/tenant-admin/orders/bulk/route.ts` - Added rate limiting to bulk order actions

- **Features implemented**:
  - **Rate Limiting**:
    - Sliding window rate limiter: 20 requests per minute per user
    - In-memory store with automatic cleanup every 5 minutes
    - Returns 429 status with Retry-After header when limit exceeded
    - Includes X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset headers
    - Applied to all admin API routes (super-admin and tenant-admin)
  - **React Query Caching**:
    - Global QueryClient with default 1-minute stale time and 5-minute garbage collection
    - Analytics hooks (useTenantAnalytics, useSuperAdminAnalytics) with 5-minute stale time
    - List data hooks (useTenants, useProducts, useOrders) with 1-minute stale time
    - Mutation hooks with automatic cache invalidation (useTenantBulkAction, useProductBulkAction, useOrderBulkAction)
    - TypeScript generics for type-safe filter parameters
    - Automatic refetch on mutation success to keep data fresh
  - Typecheck passed with `npm run build`

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Rate limiting implementation uses in-memory store - for production at scale, migrate to Redis for distributed rate limiting
  - React Query's `staleTime` controls how long data is considered fresh (no refetch on mount), `gcTime` (formerly `cacheTime`) controls how long unused data stays in cache
  - The `checkRateLimit()` function pattern makes it easy to add rate limiting to any API route with a single function call
  - Mutation hooks should use `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` in `onSuccess` callback to automatically refetch related data
  - QueryProvider must be placed inside SessionProvider but outside ThemeProvider in the provider hierarchy
  - @tanstack/react-query version 5.x uses `gcTime` instead of `cacheTime` - old API deprecated
  - Custom hooks pattern (useAnalytics, useAdminData) provides centralized caching configuration and DRY principle
  - Rate limit headers (Retry-After, X-RateLimit-*) help clients implement intelligent retry logic

    - Super Admin: slate-400 rings with animated scale-in effect
    - Tenant Admin: cyan-400 rings with animated scale-in effect
    - Enhanced glow variants with subtle pulse animation for primary CTAs
  - **Skip-to-content link**:
    - Hidden off-screen until focused with Tab key
    - Slides down dramatically with animation on focus
    - Theme-specific styling matching admin panel colors
    - Smooth scroll to #main-content element
    - ARIA label for screen readers
  - **Focus trap for modals**:
    - Radix UI Dialog automatically handles focus trapping
    - Custom createFocusTrap() utility for non-Radix modals
    - Tab cycles through focusable elements within modal
    - Shift+Tab cycles backwards
    - Escape closes modal
    - Focus returns to trigger element on close

    - focus-ring: 0.15s scale-in animation (0.95 to 1.0)
    - focus-pulse: 2s infinite pulse for enhanced focus states
    - skip-link-slide: 0.2s slide-down from off-screen
  - **Utility classes for consistent application**:
    - `.focus-super-admin` - Standard slate ring with offset
    - `.focus-tenant-admin` - Standard cyan ring with offset
    - `.focus-super-admin-inset` - Inset slate ring (no offset)

    - ACCESSIBILITY.md covers all focus state patterns
    - Usage examples for developers
    - Keyboard navigation guide
    - ARIA attribute reference
    - Testing instructions
    - Best practices checklist

- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - **Precision Navigation System aesthetic**: Focus states feel like targeting reticles with satisfying visual feedback (scale animation + optional pulse)
  - All shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Checkbox, Select, Dialog) already have focus-visible:ring-2 built in
  - Radix UI Dialog handles focus trapping automatically - no need for custom implementation in most cases
  - The AccessibleAdminLayout wrapper pattern allows easy integration of skip-to-content links across all admin pages
  - Theme-specific focus rings reinforce the visual identity of each admin panel (slate for command center, cyan for living garden)
  - Focus animations should be subtle and fast (0.15s) to not interfere with rapid keyboard navigation
  - Skip-to-content links should be positioned at z-index 100 to ensure they appear above all other content when focused
  - The `-translate-y-full` + `focus:translate-y-0` pattern creates a smooth slide-down effect for skip links
  - ARIA attributes on the main content wrapper (role="main", aria-label, tabIndex={-1}) ensure proper screen reader announcements
  - Document accessibility systems comprehensively in ACCESSIBILITY.md so future developers understand the patterns
