# BudStack SaaS Sales Pitch
## Why BudStack is the Better Choice vs Building Your Own Dr. Green Frontend

---

## 🎯 The Problem

You've invested €10,000+ in your **Dr. Green NFT license**. Now what?

**Without BudStack, you face:**
- ⏰ **3-6 months** of development time building a frontend from scratch
- 💶 **€15,000-€40,000** hiring developers (or more if you want it done right)
- 🛠️ Ongoing maintenance, hosting, security updates, bugs
- 📱 Mobile optimization, SEO, compliance — all on you
- 🔧 Managing servers, databases, SSL certificates, backups
- 😰 Customer support headaches when things break at 2am

> **Reality check:** Most NFT holders are entrepreneurs, not web developers. Building a production-grade medical cannabis e-commerce platform is *hard*.

## ✅ The BudStack Solution

**Your store is live in 5 minutes. Not 5 months.**

BudStack is the **Shopify for Dr. Green NFT holders**. We've already built the platform — you just plug in your branding and start selling.

Buy NFT License → Sign up with BudStack → 5 minutes later: Your store is live! 🚀
